//File specification for unit types

The first lines specify size of the map. So like, 

5,5 = A 5 by 5 map (duh)

Each "block" of info will look like this:

0, 2, Wall, BrickWall1

If no obstruction on a node,

0, 2, 0, Grass1

The first number (0 in the above case) is the X-coordinate of the node
The second number (2 in the above case) is the Y-coordinate of the node
The third field is the type of the obstruction on the node, or 0 if there are no obstructions.
The fourth field is the visual "background" of the node. This will allow us to plug in separate art-files to make maps look different.
