//File specification for unit types

Each "block" of info will look like this:

0, 2, Scout, 0, Grass1

or this:

0, 2, 0, Wall, BrickWall1

The first number (0 in the above case) is the X-coordinate of the node
The second number (2 in the above case) is the Y-coordinate of the node
The third field is the type of unit on that node, or 0, if there is no unit.
The fourth field is the type of the obstruction on the node, or 0 if there are no obstructions.
The fifth field is the visual "background" of the node. This will allow us to plug in separate art-files to make maps look different.  


If we are implementing more than 1 unit per GraphNode, the "block" of data will look like this:

0, 2, Scout, 0, Grass1
0, 2, Knight
0, 2, Archer

The above specifies the unit we need, without having to re-apply art/wall settings each time.
