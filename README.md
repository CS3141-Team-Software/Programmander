Not the final version, there was an interesting deletion of everything. I do not know if this runs.


An educational tool that helps teach basic coding and logic.

#### To run:


1. Clone the repo, and run `ant build`.
2. The directory `programmander` is the directory that you can run from.
3. Run Programmander.jar
